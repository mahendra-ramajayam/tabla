It is made by bombarding curium atoms with calcium. The most stable isotope has a half-life of about 53 milliseconds.","history":"Four isotopes of this element have been produced and they have mass numbers 290-293. The longest-lived is 293 with a half-life of 61 milliseconds.There were several attempts to make element 116 but all were unsuccessful until 2000 when researchers at the Joint International Nuclear Research (JINR) in Russia, led by Yuri Oganessian, Vladimir Utyonkov, and Kenton Moody observed it. Because the discovery was made using essential target material supplied by the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) in the USA, it was decided to name it after that facility.In1999, the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California had announced the discovery of element 116 but then it was discovered that evidence had simply been concocted by one of their scientists, and so the claim had to be withdrawn.","covalentRadius":1.75,"oxidationStates":[]}
