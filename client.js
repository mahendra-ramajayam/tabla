In the chemical industry it is used to make ammonia for agricultural fertiliser (the Haber process) and cyclohexane and methanol, which are intermediates in the production of plastics and pharmaceuticals. It is also used to remove sulfur from fuels during the oil-refining process. Large quantities of hydrogen are used to hydrogenate oils to form fats, for example to make margarine. In the glass industry hydrogen is used as a protective atmosphere for making flat glass sheets. In the electronics industry it is used as a flushing gas during the manufacture of silicon chips.

In 1671 Robert Boyle made the same observation. Neither followed up their discovery of hydrogen, and so Henry Cavendish gets the credit. In 1766 he collected the bubbles and showed that they were different from other gases. He later showed that when hydrogen burns it forms water, thereby ending the belief that water was an element. The gas was given its name hydro-gen, meaning water-former, by Antoine Lavoisier.In 1931, Harold Urey and his colleagues at Columbia University in the US detected a second, rarer, form of hydrogen.

These aluminium coatings have many uses, including telescope mirrors, decorative paper, packages and toys.',biologicalRole:'Aluminium has no known biological role. In its soluble +3 form it is toxic to plants. Acidic soils make up almost half of arable land on Earth, and the acidity speeds up the release of Al3+ from its minerals.

Foods with above average amounts of aluminium are tea, processed cheese, lentils and sponge cakes (where it comes from the raising agent). Cooking in aluminium pans does not greatly increase the amount in our diet, except when cooking acidic foods such as rhubarb. Some indigestion tablets are pure aluminium hydroxide.

Silicone rubber is used as a waterproof sealant in bathrooms and around windows, pipes and roofs. The element silicon is used extensively as a semiconductor in solid-state devices in the computer and microelectronics industries. For this, hyperpure silicon is needed. The silicon is selectively doped with tiny amounts of boron, gallium, phosphorus or arsenic to control its electrical properties. Granite and most other rocks are complex silicates, and these are used for civil engineering projects.

This involved forcing super-heated steam into the underground deposits to melt the sulfur, so it could be pumped to the surface as a liquid. Modern sulfur production is almost entirely from the various purification processes used to remove sulfur from natural gas, oil and tar sands. All living things contain sulfur and when fossilised (as in fossil fuels) the sulfur remains present. If unpurified fossil fuels are burnt, sulfur dioxide can enter the atmosphere, leading to acid rain.',history:'Sulfur is mentioned 15 times in the Bible, and was best known for destroying Sodom and Gomorrah. It was also known to the ancient Greeks, and burnt as a fumigant. Sulfur was mined near Mount Etna in Sicily and used for bleaching cloth and preserving wine, both of which involved burning it to form sulfur dioxide, and allowing this to be absorbed by wet clothes or the grape juice. For centuries, sulfur along with mercury and salt, was believed to be a component of all metals and formed the basis of alchemy whereby one metal could be transmuted into another.Antoine Lavoisier thought that sulfur was an element, but in 1808 Humphry Davy  said it contained hydrogen. However, his sample was impure and when Louis-Josef Gay-Lussac and Louis-Jacques Th\xE9nard proved it to be an element the following year, Davy eventually agreed.',atomicRadius:1.8,electronAffinity:200.41,covalentRadius:1.04,electronegativity:2.58,oxidationStates:[6,4,2,-2]}},function(e){e.exports={atomicNumber:17,symbol:'Cl',name:'Chlorine',group:17,groupBlock:'halogen',meltingPoint:171.7,boilingPoint:239.11,density:0.002898,atomicMass:35.45,keyIsotopes:[35,37],ionisationEnergies:[1251.186,2297.663,3821.78,5158.608,6541.7,9361.97,11018.221,33603.91],cas:'7782-50-5',period:3,block:'p',stateAt20c:'Gas',electronicConfiguration:[10,{shell:3,subshell:'s',electrons:2},{shell:3,subshell:'p',electrons:5}],appearance:'A yellowy-green dense gas with a choking smell.',uses:'Chlorine kills bacteria \u2013 it is a disinfectant.

These nodules contain about 24% manganese, along with smaller amounts of many other elements.',history:'Manganese in the form of the black ore pyrolucite (manganese dioxide, MnO2) was used by the pre-historic cave painters of the Lascaux region of France around 30,000 years ago. In more recent times was used by glass makers to remove the pale greenish tint of natural glass.In 1740, the Berlin glass technologist Johann Heinrich Pott investigated it chemically and showed that it contained no iron as has been assumed. From it he was able to make potassium permanganate (KMnO4), one of the strongest oxidising agents known. Several chemists in the 1700s tried unsuccessfully to isolate the metal component in pyrolusite. The first person to do this was the Swedish chemist and mineralogist Johan Gottlieb Gahn in 1774. However, a student at Vienna, Ignatius Kaim, had already described how he had produced manganese metal, in his dissertation written in 1771.',atomicRadius:2.05,covalentRadius:1.29,electronegativity:1.55,oxidationStates:[7,6,4,3,2,-1]}},function(e){e.exports={atomicNumber:26,symbol:'Fe',name:'Iron',group:8,groupBlock:'transitionMetal',meltingPoint:1811,boilingPoint:3134,density:7.87,atomicMass:55.845,keyIsotopes:56,ionisationEnergies:[762.466,1561.876,2957.469,5287.4,7236,9561.7,12058.74,14575.08],cas:'7439-89-6',period:4,block:'d',stateAt20c:'Solid',electronicConfiguration:[18,{shell:3,subshell:'d',electrons:6},{shell:4,subshell:'s',electrons:2}],appearance:'A shiny, greyish metal that rusts in damp air.',uses:'Iron is an enigma \u2013 it rusts easily, yet it is the most important of all metals. 90% of all metal that is refined today is iron. Most is used to manufacture steel, used in civil engineering (reinforced concrete, girders etc) and in manufacturing. There are many different types of steel with different properties and uses. Ordinary carbon steel is an alloy of iron with carbon (from 0.1% for mild steel up to 2% for high carbon steels), with small amounts of other elements. Alloy steels are carbon steels with other additives such as nickel, chromium, vanadium, tungsten and manganese. These are stronger and tougher than carbon steels and have a huge variety of applications including bridges, electricity pylons, bicycle chains, cutting tools and rifle barrels.Stainless steel is very resistant to corrosion. It contains at least 10.5% chromium. Other metals such as nickel, molybdenum, titanium and copper are added to enhance its strength and workability. It is used in architecture, bearings, cutlery, surgical instruments and jewellery.Cast iron contains 3\u20135% carbon. It is used for pipes, valves and pumps. It is not as tough as steel but it is cheaper. Magnets can be made of iron and its alloys and compounds.Iron catalysts are used in the Haber process for producing ammonia, and in the Fischer\u2013Tropsch process for converting syngas (hydrogen and carbon monoxide) into liquid fuels.',biologicalRole:'Iron is an essential element for all forms of life and is non-toxic. The average human contains about 4 grams of iron. A lot of this is in haemoglobin, in the blood. Haemoglobin carries oxygen from our lungs to the cells, where it is needed for tissue respiration.

The core of the Earth is thought to be largely composed of iron with nickel and sulfur. The most common iron-containing ore is haematite, but iron is found widely distributed in other minerals such as magnetite and taconite. Commercially, iron is produced in a blast furnace by heating haematite or magnetite with coke (carbon) and limestone (calcium carbonate). This forms pig iron, which contains about 3% carbon and other impurities, but is used to make steel. Around 1.3 billion tonnes of crude steel are produced worldwide each year.',history:'Iron objects have been found in Egypt dating from around 3500 BC. They contain about 7.5% nickel, which indicates that they were of meteoric origin.The ancient Hittites of Asia Minor, today\u2019s Turkey, were the first to smelt iron from its ores around 1500 BC and this new, stronger, metal gave them economic and political power. The Iron Age had begun. Some kinds of iron were clearly superior to others depending on its carbon content, although this was not appreciated. Some iron ore contained vanadium producing so-called Damascene steel, ideal for swords.The first person to explain the various types of iron was Ren\xE9 Antoine Ferchault de R\xE9aumur who wrote a book on the subject in 1722. This explained how steel, wrought iron, and cast iron, were to be distinguished by the amount of charcoal (carbon) they contained.

It is particularly important in the iron and steel industries. Graphite is used in pencils, to make brushes in electric motors and in furnace linings. Activated charcoal is used for purification and filtration. It is found in respirators and kitchen extractor hoods. Carbon fibre is finding many uses as a very strong, yet lightweight, material. It is currently used in tennis rackets, skis, fishing rods, rockets and aeroplanes.Industrial diamonds are used for cutting rocks and drilling. Diamond films are used to protect surfaces such as razor blades.The more recent discovery of carbon nanotubes, other fullerenes and atom-thin sheets of graphene has revolutionised hardware developments in the electronics industry and in nanotechnology generally.150 years ago the natural concentration of carbon dioxide in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere was 280 ppm. In 2013, as a result of combusting fossil fuels with oxygen, there was 390 ppm. Atmospheric carbon dioxide allows visible light in but prevents some infrared escaping (the natural greenhouse effect). This keeps the Earth warm enough to sustain life. However, an enhanced greenhouse effect is underway, due to a human-induced rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide. This is affecting living things as our climate changes.',biologicalRole:'Carbon is essential to life. This is because it is able to form a huge variety of chains of different lengths. It was once thought that the carbon-based molecules of life could only be obtained from living things. They were thought to contain a \u2018spark of life\u2019. However, in 1828, urea was synthesised from inorganic reagents and the branches of organic and inorganic chemistry were united. Living things get almost all their carbon from carbon dioxide, either from the atmosphere or dissolved in water. Photosynthesis by green plants and photosynthetic plankton uses energy from the sun to split water into oxygen and hydrogen. The oxygen is released to the atmosphere, fresh water and seas, and the hydrogen joins with carbon dioxide to produce carbohydrates. Some of the carbohydrates are used, along with nitrogen, phosphorus and other elements, to form the other monomer molecules of life. These include bases and sugars for RNA and DNA, and amino acids for proteins. Living things that do not photosynthesise have to rely on consuming other living things for their source of carbon molecules. Their digestive systems break carbohydrates into monomers that they can use to build their own cellular structures. Respiration provides the energy needed for these reactions. In respiration oxygen rejoins carbohydrates, to form carbon dioxide and water again. The energy released in this reaction is made available for the cells.',naturalAbundance:'Carbon is found in the sun and other stars, formed from the debris of a previous supernova.

Diamond is found in the form of microscopic crystals in some meteorites. Natural diamonds are found in the mineral kimberlite, sources of which are in Russia, Botswana, DR Congo, Canada and South Africa. In combination, carbon is found in all living things.

In 1694 they focussed sunlight on to a diamond using a large magnifying glass and the gem eventually disappeared. Pierre-Joseph Macquer and Godefroy de Villetaneuse repeated the experiment in 1771. Then, in 1796, the English chemist Smithson Tennant finally proved that diamond was just a form of carbon by showing that as it burned it formed only CO2.',atomicRadius:1.7,electronAffinity:121.776,covalentRadius:0.75,electronegativity:2.55,oxidationStates:[4,3,2,1,-1,-2,-3,-4]}},function(e){e.exports={atomicNumber:60,symbol:'Nd',name:'Neodymium',group:'Lanthanides',groupBlock:'lanthanoid',meltingPoint:1289,boilingPoint:3347,density:7.01,atomicMass:144.242,keyIsotopes:142,ionisationEnergies:[533.082,1034.32,2132.3,3898],cas:'7440-00-8',period:6,block:'f',stateAt20c:'Solid',electronicConfiguration:[54,{shell:4,subshell:'f',electrons:4},{shell:6,subshell:'s',electrons:2}],appearance:'A silvery-white metal.

In the chemical industry it is used to make ammonia for agricultural fertiliser (the Haber process) and cyclohexane and methanol, which are intermediates in the production of plastics and pharmaceuticals. It is also used to remove sulfur from fuels during the oil-refining process. Large quantities of hydrogen are used to hydrogenate oils to form fats, for example to make margarine.

These hydrocarbons, extracted naturally as fossil fuels (coal, oil and natural gas), are mostly used as fuels. A small but important fraction is used as a feedstock for the petrochemical industries producing polymers, fibres, paints, solvents and plastics etc. Impure carbon in the form of charcoal (from wood) and coke (from coal) is used in metal smelting. It is particularly important in the iron and steel industries. Graphite is used in pencils, to make brushes in electric motors and in furnace linings. Activated charcoal is used for purification and filtration. It is found in respirators and kitchen extractor hoods. Carbon fibre is finding many uses as a very strong, yet lightweight, material. It is currently used in tennis rackets, skis, fishing rods, rockets and aeroplanes.Industrial diamonds are used for cutting rocks and drilling. Diamond films are used to protect surfaces such as razor blades.The more recent discovery of carbon nanotubes, other fullerenes and atom-thin sheets of graphene has revolutionised hardware developments in the electronics industry and in nanotechnology generally.150 years ago the natural concentration of carbon dioxide in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere was 280 ppm. In 2013, as a result of combusting fossil fuels with oxygen, there was 390 ppm. Atmospheric carbon dioxide allows visible light in but prevents some infrared escaping (the natural greenhouse effect). This keeps the Earth warm enough to sustain life. However, an enhanced greenhouse effect is underway, due to a human-induced rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide. This is affecting living things as our climate changes.',biologicalRole:'Carbon is essential to life. This is because it is able to form a huge variety of chains of different lengths. It was once thought that the carbon-based molecules of life could only be obtained from living things. They were thought to contain a \u2018spark of life\u2019. However, in 1828, urea was synthesised from inorganic reagents and the branches of organic and inorganic chemistry were united. Living things get almost all their carbon from carbon dioxide, either from the atmosphere or dissolved in water. Photosynthesis by green plants and photosynthetic plankton uses energy from the sun to split water into oxygen and hydrogen. The oxygen is released to the atmosphere, fresh water and seas, and the hydrogen joins with carbon dioxide to produce carbohydrates. Some of the carbohydrates are used, along with nitrogen, phosphorus and other elements, to form the other monomer molecules of life. These include bases and sugars for RNA and DNA, and amino acids for proteins. Living things that do not photosynthesise have to rely on consuming other living things for their source of carbon molecules. Their digestive systems break carbohydrates into monomers that they can use to build their own cellular structures. Respiration provides the energy needed for these reactions. In respiration oxygen rejoins carbohydrates, to form carbon dioxide and water again. The energy released in this reaction is made available for the cells.',naturalAbundance:'Carbon is found in the sun and other stars, formed from the debris of a previous supernova.

Diamond is found in the form of microscopic crystals in some meteorites. Natural diamonds are found in the mineral kimberlite, sources of which are in Russia, Botswana, DR Congo, Canada and South Africa. In combination, carbon is found in all living things.

In 1694 they focussed sunlight on to a diamond using a large magnifying glass and the gem eventually disappeared. Pierre-Joseph Macquer and Godefroy de Villetaneuse repeated the experiment in 1771. Then, in 1796, the English chemist Smithson Tennant finally proved that diamond was just a form of carbon by showing that as it burned it formed only CO2.',atomicRadius:1.7,electronAffinity:121.776,covalentRadius:0.75,electronegativity:2.55,oxidationStates:[4,3,2,1,-1,-2,-3,-4]},{atomicNumber:7,symbol:'N',name:'Nitrogen',group:15,groupBlock:'nonMetal',meltingPoint:63.2,boilingPoint:77.355,density:0.001145,atomicMass:14.007,keyIsotopes:14,ionisationEnergies:[1402.328,2856.092,4578.156,7475.057,9444.969,53266.835,64360.16],cas:'7727-37-9',period:2,block:'p',stateAt20c:'Gas',electronicConfiguration:[2,{shell:2,subshell:'s',electrons:2},{shell:2,subshell:'p',electrons:3}],appearance:'A colourless, odourless gas.',uses:'Nitrogen is important to the chemical industry.

Animals obtain their nitrogen by consuming other living things. They digest the proteins and DNA into their constituent bases and amino acids, reforming them for their own use. Microbes in the soil convert the nitrogen compounds back to nitrates for the plants to re-use. The nitrate supply is also replenished by nitrogen-fixing bacteria that \u2018fix\u2019 nitrogen directly from the atmosphere. Crop yields can be greatly increased by adding chemical fertilisers to the soil, manufactured from ammonia.

He realised from lines in its atomic spectrum that it contained an unknown element. He wrongly thought it was the one directly below manganese and so his claim was discounted at the time. However, a re-examination of Ogawa\u2019s original photographic spectra proved he had discovered rhenium.The isolation of rhenium was finally achieved in May 1925 by Walter Noddack and Ida Tacke working in Berlin.

By a combination of acid and alkali treatments he eventually separated it into two new metal elements, which he named iridium and osmium, naming the latter on account of the strong odour it gave off.
