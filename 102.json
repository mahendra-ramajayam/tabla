It is toxic due to its radioactivity.","naturalAbundance":"Nobelium is made by bombarding curium with carbon in a device called a cyclotron.","history":"This elementâ€™s history is one of controversy. In 1956, a team led by Georgy Flerov at the Institute of Atomic Energy, Moscow, synthesised element 102 by bombarding plutonium with oxygen and got atoms of element 102, isotope-252. However, they did not report their success.In 1957, the Nobel Institute of Physics in Stockholm announced isotope-253 which had been made by bombarding curium with carbon. Then in 1958, Albert Ghiorso at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory (LBL) claimed isotope-254, also made by bombarding curium with carbon. These claims were challenged by the Russians.In 1962-63, the Russian Joint Institute of Nuclear Research, based at Dubna, synthesised isotopes 252 to 256. Ghiorso still insisted his group were the first to discover element 102, and so began years of recrimination, finally ending in the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemists deciding in favour of the Russians being the discoverers.","atomicRadius":2.46,"covalentRadius":1.76,"oxidationStates":[3,2]}
