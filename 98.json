It is used in portable metal detectors, for identifying gold and silver ores, to identify water and oil layers in oil wells and to detect metal fatigue and stress in aeroplanes.","biologicalRole":"Californium has no known biological role. It is toxic due to its radioactivity.","naturalAbundance":"Californium did not exist in weighable amounts until ten years after its discovery. It is prepared, in milligram amounts only, by the neutron bombardment of plutonium-239.","history":"Californium was first made in 1950 at Berkeley, California, by a team consisting of Stanley Thompson, Kenneth Street Jr., Albert Ghiorso, and Glenn Seaborg. They made it by firing helium nuclei (alpha particles) at curium-242. The process yielded the isotope californium-245 which has a half-life of 44 minutes. Curium is intensely radioactive and it had taken the team three years to collect the few milligrams needed for the experiment, and even so only a few micrograms of this were used. Their endeavours produced around 5,000 atoms of californium, but there was enough to show it really was a new element.","atomicRadius":2.45,"covalentRadius":1.68,"oxidationStates":[4,3]}
