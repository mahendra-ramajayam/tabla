In this a uranium-238 bomb was used to provide the heat necessary to trigger a thermonuclear explosion. The uranium-238 had been exposed to such a flux of neutrons that some of its atoms had captured several of them, thereby forming elements of atomic numbers 93 to 100, and among the last of these was an isotope of element 100, fermium-255. News of its discovery was kept secret until 1955.Meanwhile a group at the Nobel Institute in Stockholm had independently made a few atoms of fermium by bombarding uranium-238 with oxygen nuclei and obtained fermium-250, which has a half-life of 30 minutes.","atomicRadius":2.45,"covalentRadius":1.67,"oxidationStates":[3]}
