It is a transuranium element created by bombarding californium-249 with nitrogen-15 nuclei.","history":"In 1968, a team led by Georgy Flerov at the Russian Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) bombarded americium with neon and made an isotope of element 105. In 1970, a team led by Albert Ghiorso at the American Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory (LBL) bombarded californium with neon and obtained isotope 261. They disputed the claim of the JINR people. The two groups gave it different names. The Russians called it neilsbohrium, while the Americans called it hahnium, both being derived from the names of prominent nuclear scientists.Eventually, the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) decided it should be called dubnium.","covalentRadius":1.49,"oxidationStates":[]}
