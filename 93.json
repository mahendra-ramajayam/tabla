The isotope neptunium-237 has been used in neutron detectors.","biologicalRole":"Neptunium has no known biological role. It is toxic due to its radioactivity.","naturalAbundance":"Neptunium is obtained as a by-product from nuclear reactors. It is extracted from the spent uranium fuel rods. Trace quantities occur naturally in uranium ores.","history":"In early 1934, Enrico Fermi in Italy tried to produce elements 93 and 94 by bombarding uranium with neutrons, and claimed success. Ida Tacke-Noddack questioned Fermiâ€™s claim, pointing out he had failed to do a complete analysis, and all that he had found were fission products of uranium. (Fermi had in fact discovered nuclear fission but not realised it.) In 1938, Horia Hulubei and Yvette Cauchois claimed to have discovered element 93, but the claim was also criticised on the grounds that element 93 did not occur naturally.Neptunium was first made in 1940 by Edwin McMillan and Philip Abelson at Berkeley, California. It came from a uranium target that had been bombarded with slow neutrons and which then emitted unusual beta-rays indicating a new isotope. Abelson proved there was indeed a new element present.","atomicRadius":2.39,"covalentRadius":1.8,"electronegativity":1.3,"oxidationStates":[6,5,4,3]}
