The longest-lived is 289 and it has a half-life of 2.6 seconds. Nuclear theory suggests that isotope 298, with 184 neutrons, should be much more stable but that has yet to be made.Despite several attempts to make element 114, it was only in 1998 that a team led by Yuri Oganessian and Vladimir Utyonkov at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Russia produced it by bombarding plutonium with calcium. It needed 5 billion billion (5 x 1018) atoms of calcium to be fired at the target to produce a single atom of flerovium, in an experiment lasting 40 days. A few more two atoms were produced the following year.","electronAffinity":null,"covalentRadius":1.43,"oxidationStates":[]}
