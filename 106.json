It is created by bombarding californium-249 with oxygen-18 nuclei.","history":"In 1970, a team led by Albert Ghiorso at the Californian Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) bombarded californium with oxygen and was successful in producing element 106, isotope 263. In 1974, a team led by Georgy Flerov and Yuri Oganessian at the Russian Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) bombarded lead with chromium and obtained isotopes 259 and 260.In September 1974, a team led by Ghiorso at LBNL produced isotope 263, with a half-life of 0.8 seconds, by bombarding californium with oxygen. Several atoms of seaborgium have since been made by this method which produces one seaborgium atom per hour.","covalentRadius":1.43,"oxidationStates":[]}
