It is made by bombarding einsteinium with alpha particles (helium ions).","history":"Seventeen atoms of mendelevium were made in 1955 by Albert Ghiorso, Bernard Harvey, Gregory Chopin, Stanley Thompson, and Glenn Seaborg. They were produced during an all-night experiment using the cyclotron at Berkeley, California. In this, a sample of einsteinium-253 was bombarded with alpha-particles (helium nuclei) and mendelevium-256 was detected. This had a half-life of around 78 minutes. Further experiments yielded several thousand atoms of mendelevium, and today it is possible to produce millions of them. The longest lived isotope is mendelevium-260 which has a half-life of 28 days.","atomicRadius":2.46,"covalentRadius":1.73,"oxidationStates":[3]}
