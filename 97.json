It is toxic due to its radioactivity.","naturalAbundance":"Less than a gram of berkelium is made each year. It is made in nuclear reactors by the neutron bombardment of plutonium-239.","history":"Berkelium was first produced in December 1949, at the University of California at Berkeley, and was made by Stanley Thompson, Albert Ghiorso, and Glenn Seaborg. They took americium-241, which had first been made in 1944, and bombarded it with helium nuclei (alpha particles) for several hours in the 60-inch cyclotron. The americium itself had been produced by bombarding plutonium with neutrons.The Berkeley team dissolved the target in acid and used ion exchange to separate the new elements that had been created. This was the isotope berkelium-243 which has a half-life of about 5 hours. It took a further nine years before enough berkelium had been made to see with the naked eye, and even this was only a few micrograms. The first chemical compound, berkelium dioxide, BkO2, was made in 1962.","atomicRadius":2.44,"covalentRadius":1.68,"oxidationStates":[4,3]}
